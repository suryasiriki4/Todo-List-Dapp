This is a todo list application that will talk directly to the ethereum blockchain for storing the tasks.
 
I use an ethereum account created locally with the help of ganache.
I use a meta mask ethereum wallet to connect to this account.
I used the truffle framework for migration of the smart contracts onto the blockchain.

Here's a demo of the app:
